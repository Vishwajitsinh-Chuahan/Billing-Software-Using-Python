# Billing-Software-Using-Python
"This is a mini project in Python on how to create a billing software. In this project, we can add items along with their categories and subcategories. We calculate the total amount and generate a bill. Additionally, we can add items to the cart, generate a bill, save the bill in txt format and take print of the bill and we can clear the data."
